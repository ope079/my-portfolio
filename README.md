# My Portfolio

## The Task

This week, the task is to build a unique portfolio website which I can add to as the course progresses.
This will be a live portfolio, deployed on github pages.

## Project Requirements

* When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications
* When presented with the my first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
